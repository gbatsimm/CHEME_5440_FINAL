### Description of Contents:

#### Core Contents:

Note, some features of the jupyter files can be hard to read in the GitHub preview.  For best readability, download the ipynb files.  Particularly tex style equations in markdown often take a good amount of time to load in the preview.  This was most notable when multiple equations are written in a row.  Each runnable Jupyter file also has an identical read only pdf version avaliable.

`5440_FINAL_Problem1.ipynb` contains the complete solution (in python 3) to Problem 1.

`5440_FINAL_Problem2.ipynb` contains the complete solution (in python 3) to Problem 2.
